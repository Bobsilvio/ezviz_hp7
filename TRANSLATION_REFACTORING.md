# Translation Refactoring Summary

This document describes the refactoring performed to make the EZVIZ HP7 Home Assistant integration support multiple languages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Translation Files

The integration now supports three languages:

- **Italian (it.json)** - Original language (previously `strings.json`)
- **English (en.json)** - New translation
- **Spanish (es.json)** - New translation

All translation files are located in: `custom_components/ezviz_hp7/translations/`

### 2. Python Code Refactoring

The following files were updated to use translation keys instead of hardcoded Italian strings:

#### sensor.py
- Changed sensor names from Italian text to translation keys
- Updated `SENSORS` list to use keys like `"name"`, `"version"`, `"status"`, etc.
- Modified `Hp7Sensor.__init__()` to use `_attr_translation_key` instead of `_attr_name`
- State values now use English keys (`"online"/"offline"`, `"active"/"inactive"`, etc.) that are translated in the JSON files

#### button.py
- Removed hardcoded Italian button names
- Updated to use `_attr_translation_key` with values `"unlock_gate"` and `"unlock_door"`
- Added `_attr_has_entity_name = True` to the class
- Changed log messages from Italian to English (logs are for developers, not end-users)

#### services.yaml
- Removed hardcoded Italian service names and descriptions
- Service translations are now handled through the translation JSON files

### 3. Translation Structure

Each translation file follows Home Assistant's standard structure:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "step": { ... },      // Configuration flow steps
    "error": { ... },     // Error messages
    "abort": { ... }      // Abort messages
  },
  "entity": {
    "sensor": { ... },           // Sensor entity names and states
    "button": { ... }            // Button entity names
  },
  "services": {
    "unlock_gate": { ... },  // Service descriptions
    "unlock_door": { ... }
  }
}
```

### 4. How Translation Works

Home Assistant automatically selects the appropriate translation file based on the user's language settings:

- User with Italian locale → uses `it.json`
- User with English locale → uses `en.json`
- User with Spanish locale → uses `es.json`
- User with other locales → falls back to `en.json` (if configured) or shows translation keys

### 5. Key Benefits

✅ **Multi-language Support**: The integration now works seamlessly in Italian, English, and Spanish

✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to add new languages by creating additional JSON files

✅ **Best Practices**: Follows Home Assistant's official translation guidelines

✅ **User Experience**: Users see the interface in their preferred language automatically

## Translated Elements

### Configuration Flow
- Connection titles and descriptions
- Device selection prompts
- Error messages
- Field labels (username, password, region, serial number)

### Sensors
- Device Name
- Firmware
- Status (online/offline)
- WiFi Signal
- WiFi SSID
- Local IP
- WAN IP
- PIR Motion (active/inactive)
- Motion (detected/none)
- Last Alarm
- Alarm Type
- Seconds Since Last Motion
- Update Available (yes/no)

### Binary Sensors
- Motion

### Buttons
- Unlock Gate
- Unlock Door

### Services
- Unlock gate (with description and field labels)
- Unlock door (with description and field labels)

## Testing

To test the translations:

1. Go to Home Assistant Settings → System → General
2. Change the language to Italian, English, or Spanish
3. Add a new EZVIZ HP7 integration
4. Verify all text appears in the selected language
5. Check entity names in the Entities list
6. Check service descriptions in Developer Tools → Services

## Adding New Languages

To add support for another language:

1. Copy `en.json` to a new file named with the appropriate language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French, `de.json` for German)
2. Translate all the text values (keep the keys unchanged)
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. The new language will be automatically available

## Notes

- Log messages in the Python code remain in English as they are for developers/debugging
- Translation keys must match exactly between the Python code and JSON files
- State values (like "online", "offline", "active", etc.) are also translatable
